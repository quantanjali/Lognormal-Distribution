# Lognormal-Distribution
Case Study: Normal Distribution and Stock Prices

Activity 1 :
Consider the following values for this project: St = 10$ , r = 0.15 (15% expected return per year), σ =0.20 (20% annual volatility in prices), T = 1 year, N=100, ε =0.15 Where : St +1 = St exp((r - 1/2 σ2) Δt + σ ∈√Δt

ACTIVITY 2 :
Starting with the initial stock price St as specified, and considering 100 Steps, Calculate the expected value of the stock price at the end of every successive Δt interval of time

ACTIVITY 3 :
Plot the entire movement of prices over the T period under observation.

ACTIVITY 4 :
Instead of considering a fixed ε as in the previous steps, randomly assign values to ε from a standard normal distribution.

ACTIVITY 5 :
QUESTION 5. Perform 5 trials of 100 steps each to plot the probable movement of stock prices over a 1-year period. Plot each trajectory of prices as a separate line

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
1. How wide a variance is noticeable in the final year- end price of the stock for the 5 separate trials performed through steps IV and V? Analyze and draw  conclusions.

2. Would the variance have been higher if ε was assigned purely on a random basis from an arbitrary distribution?
If we look at the two plot of price movement, where in first plot Epsilon is 0.15 and in another, it is 100 random variable which is part of normal distribution and have mean as 0 and standard
deviation as 1. Variance have been higher when ε was assigned purely on a random basis from an arbitrary distribution, while its lower when it is fixed at 0.15, hence true.
